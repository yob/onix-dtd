2000-11-27: Amendment of Revision 03c for Release 1.2

     1. A new version and revision numbering system has been introduced. In future the 
        DTD version number will match the public release number and the revision number 
        will be incremented by one for each revision of the DTD that is publicly 
        released, however minor. Revision numbers will be kept in step on both this 
        file and ONIX-INTERNATIONAL.DTD. If at a future time the DTD is replaced by a 
        Schema, it is anticipated that revisions of code lists will use the same release 
        number but will not carry a revision number, as only the most recently-issued 
        version is expected to be valid.
     2. Marked sections have been added using the parameter entity %GroupsAsElements; to 
        enable a version of the DTD to be generated that contains all Groups and 
        SuperGroups declared as elements instead of simply as parameter entities 
        containing content model fragments. This device has been added to facilitate the 
        generation of graphical views of the DTD for use in the ONIX Level 2 Guide.

        %MediaFileFormatType; optional

     3. Short tag name of element %Prize; changed from "Prize" to "prize"
     4. Short tag names moved into this module.

Declared below are the names to be used by default in ONIX International applications. If the replacement value of the parameter entity %UsingReferenceNames; is set to "INCLUDE" (in the local names definition module), the reference names are used in their place. Alternatively a list of local names is defined and activated in the local names template at the top of this file by defining a complete set of local names and by setting the replacement value of the parameter entity %UsingLocalNames; to "INCLUDE".
